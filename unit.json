In many materials, including single crystals, textured polycrystals and composites, the physical properties depend on the direction, i.e. they are anisotropic. Describing anisotropy requires proper mathematical tools, as well as an understanding of the material structure at the relevant length scale in order to quantify the property coefficients in various directions. In this unit, we introduce tensors and matrices as mathematical tools to describe anisotropic properties and calculate property relationships in different directions. Material symmetry arguments are introduced to identify the number of independent property coefficients. Mechanical, thermal and electrical properties are systematically investigated (elasticity, electrical permittivity, heat conduction...), including coupled effects (e.g. piezoelectricity, thermal expansion...). Practical problems involving tensor operations are solved using the Python programming language. While there is no formal prerequisite for this unit, basic knowledge in Thermodynamics and Crystallography (MTE 2541 or equivalent), Mechanics of Materials (MTE2546 or equivalent) will be highly beneficial, as well as basic programming skills (ENG1060 or equivalent).",

We examine the military ideology of the Assyrians, the internationalism of the Persians, the culture of classical Athens that built the Parthenon, the sweeping conquests of Alexander the Great, the hybrid culture of Kleopatra's Egypt, and the economic-military power of Rome under Caesar and Augustus.

Developing knowledge of Russian and American politics and societies, students will enhance their understanding of the dynamics of governing ethnically and religiously diverse societies with many competing-and at times sharply antagonistic-interests, and countries with substantial military and economic prowess. The unit closely analyses both countries' political cultures, electoral politics, political institutions and contemporary social issues (i.e., debates over gender and minority rights), and struggles with extremism and terrorism. Notably, the subject addresses the extent to which Russia's conception of 'Sovereign Democracy' and the US' 'American Exceptionalism' influence how Russian and American citizens (and politicians) view themselves and their countries' status in the world, and if this makes them unique as powerful states, or whether their political behaviour and sense of national identity and destiny are common amongst modern nation-states. Upon completing the subject, students should have also developed a nuanced grasp of the broader field of comparative politics, and its main conceptual approaches and interpretive frameworks-to complement their knowledge of Russian and US politics.",

This unit is a practice driven, workshop based unit which explores varied drawing methodologies and ways they can contribute to a research practice in visual culture. It is designed to develop, challenge and expand how students think about making artwork and to develop research skills. A series of individual and collaborative exercises and projects are presented as starting points that, when navigated, foster creative research skills and develop students' material skills. The main emphasis of this class is to demonstrate how thinking operates through making. Fabrication processes in the workshop can be in any medium from across two- and/or three-dimensional works, to sound and performance. The aim of these exercises is to have a generative influence on production, creating a pool of ideas, strategies, forms and processes for students to draw on and develop as they progress through the course. Teaching methodology involves critical dialogue, classroom discussion and peer review. This unit presents a broad range of approaches to contemporary art and its institutions for those wishing to work in the arts industry as artists, curators, arts writers, educators or practitioners. Research Practices encourages an experimental approach to conceptual and material outcomes. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication and materials are core values in the unit.",

A student project, involving the initial design stages of a flight vehicle, will integrate these studies. Various characteristics of aircraft performance and their design implications will be examined including whole-aircraft drag polar, power plant characterisation, thrust required in level flight, maximum speed estimation, minimum speed and high-lift devices, rate of climb, gliding, range, endurance, accelerated flight, structural limitations on performance, and design for longitudinal and lateral stability. Mission analysis and preliminary weight estimation based on a design concept will be examined together with the aerodynamic synthesis to satisfy performance requirements, power plant selection, overall vehicle layout and balance. Trade-offs as a necessary part of the design will be apparent to students on completion of this unit.",

Leadership of social change and social justice in the human services is now at a premium, having been given little attention in the past or currently. Little is known of leadership requirements in this sector particularly as contrasted with other service sectors. Students undertaking this unit will be introduced to theories of leadership of human-service organisations, their programs and policies, and leadership of the new organisational phenomena in this sector, large community service departments, non-governmental consortia, and advocacy organisations.

The decision must be made at the time of choosing the project topic for MNE4050. The aim in choosing MNE4050 and MNE4070 together is to gain knowledge across two differing project areas within mining, as opposed to MNE4050 and MNE4060 which provides depth in one project topic. Students undertake an individual self-guided learning task in the form of a research project. The project topic must be in a significantly different mining area to the topic chosen in MNE4050. Greater depth is expected in the investigation of the topic compared to MNE4050 since the basic research skills have already been developed previously. However, the depth expected is less than that required in the full year single project topic completed as MNE4050 and MNE4070 together. The project may be undertaken within the department or externally within a company. In either case, an academic member of staff will act as the supervisor.",

We examine accounts of female and male sexuality -as well as the ambiguously gendered images of eunuchs- and attempt to untangle the cultural mesh that is formed by the intersection of sexuality and power.

It aims to help students integrate the diverse discipline knowledge and skills they acquired in prior studies and apply their learning to solve business problems. Students will identify innovative solutions to problems in a simulated experiential environment from a total organisation perspective. In the unit students are expected to bring together all the essential elements of running a business including strategic planning, leadership, ethical decision making, teamwork, cause and effect relationships between functional areas (research and development, marketing, production and finance), satisfying customer demands, and competitive analysis in a simulated learning environment. More specifically, students will learn the value of 'focusing' on the strategic implementation process, understand how decisions in one part of the business impacts other parts of the business, practice decision-making as a team across all key areas of a business, use the information from balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements to improve business decision making, analyse competitors' performance and market positioning and build core competencies within the business to take a differentiation or low cost position in the marketplace.",

The European Union is commonly seen to have been an antidote to war, ushering in an era of Kantian peace; a view powerfully endorsed by the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the EU in 2012. Despite the strength of this view, recent research suggests it is possible to look at the relationship between peace and European unity differently. In fact, European unity has been propelled by war since 1945: not just at the founding moment at the end of the Second World War (NATO, EEC, WEU), but by anti-colonial nationalists pushing European powers towards pro-active European policies, and in EU responses to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia (OSCE, CFSP), Iraq, Libya and the challenges posed by refugee movements and global terrorism. An unintended consequence of the logic of deeper integration has been the consolidation of a European identity amongst some elites, whilst political and popular support for the EU has weakened. This last development poses serious questions about the future shape the state system in what remains a major player in regimes of global governance and security.",

Key to this examination will be a discussion of the role of friendship and family within ethical decision-making. A major focus of discussion is the opposition between consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, which judge rightness and wrongness solely in terms of consequences, and the Kantian theory of deontology which judges rightness and wrongness according to whether the act is in accordance with rational will. The question that will guide this discussion is whether these theories can account for the agent-centred reasons which arise from relations of love and friendship and which seem to have the potential to conflict with impartial moral requirements?",

We examine the 'face of battle' and how war affected men and women on the front line (including indigenous servicemen), and we consider how war was experienced on the home front and reshaped Australian society. We explore the contested creation of an 'Anzac legend' and how war challenged and consolidated social relations and national identities. Students will undertake hands-on research using the rich primary source record of Australians at war, including service records, diaries and letters, oral histories, photographs and repatriation files that illuminate the impact of war on veterans, their families, and their communities.",

Ideologies offer explanations for the problems with the status quo, and advocate a programme for creating a better world. They can exert a powerful hold on their adherents, and clashes between ideologies have resulted in terrible wars. As a result, it is important to understand what different ideologies say. In this module, students will learn to identify and evaluate a variety of ideological traditions. This course will introduce students to the 'classical' political ideologies of liberalism, conservatism and socialism. It will also discuss newer ideological trends, such as feminism, green politics, and religious fundamentalism. This will equip students with the knowledge to understand the undercurrents of democratic politics.",

Literary theory refers to particular intellectual approaches or frameworks that assist us with understanding, enjoying, constructing meaning from and discussing literary texts. This unit provides a succinct and practical approach to the topic of literary theory. It provides students with the philosophical foundations of modern literary theory, and also with informative and interactive seminars on the contemporary schools of literary theory such as Marxist theory, psychoanalytic theory, poststructuralist theory, feminist theory and postcolonial theory. The unit then instructs the students on how to apply these theoretical approaches to the study of their favourite literary works, and it also provides those students interested in creative writing with the opportunity to develop their own literary and exegetical writings according to the insights of some of the world's major theorists of literature.",

While they have been advocating for a stronger voice in major international institutions such as the WTO, the World Bank and the IMF, the BRICS do not have a common identity and their influence and power at the global level is uneven. This unit covers the history of the BRICS as well as the political, economic, security and foreign policy trends in these countries. It provides different perspectives on the power of the BRICS in an international context and focuses on the challenges they face.
