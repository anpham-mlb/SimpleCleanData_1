<title> Brand management</title>
<synopsis> A brand is much more than a logo, a symbol, a sign or device, or simply the result of clever advertising. It helps to communicate value and create and deliver that value. Branding is a promise of value for customers. It helps to attract and, if it is true and accurate, keep customers. It provides an extra element of understanding or meaning, for customers as they form opinions and make purchase decisions from a variety of competing offerings. There is strong industry demand for graduates with a thorough understanding of branding. While this unit is primarily for students undertaking a major in marketing it is offered to any student with a prerequisite of an introductory marketing unit.</synopsis>

<title> Structure-property relationships in materials</title>
<synopsis> This unit deals with the mathematical description of physical properties of materials, and their relationship with the underlying microstructure at different length scales. In many materials, including single crystals, textured polycrystals and composites, the physical properties depend on the direction, i.e. they are anisotropic. Describing anisotropy requires proper mathematical tools, as well as an understanding of the material structure at the relevant length scale in order to quantify the property coefficients in various directions. In this unit, we introduce tensors and matrices as mathematical tools to describe anisotropic properties and calculate property relationships in different directions. Material symmetry arguments are introduced to identify the number of independent property coefficients. Mechanical, thermal and electrical properties are systematically investigated (elasticity, electrical permittivity, heat conduction...), including coupled effects (e.g. piezoelectricity, thermal expansion...). Practical problems involving tensor operations are solved using the Python programming language. While there is no formal prerequisite for this unit, basic knowledge in Thermodynamics and Crystallography (MTE 2541 or equivalent), Mechanics of Materials (MTE2546 or equivalent) will be highly beneficial, as well as basic programming skills (ENG1060 or equivalent).</synopsis>

How and why have people been enslaved and what did it mean to live in slavery? How might slaves understand and achieve their freedom? Why have so many societies used slave labour? In recent times, attitudes to enslavement have changed, leading to campaigns against slavery in modern times: why did this happen, and to what extent have these campaigns been successful?</synopsis>

We focus on the development of the first empires in the Mediterranean including Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Athens, Macedonia of Alexander the Great, and Rome as well as the original spread of settlements in Australia and the Pacific. We explore how archaeological remains and historical texts can be used to study the movement of people and ideas and to identify the tactics states use to expand, strengthen, and celebrate their power, including military conquest, colonisation, trade, art, and literature. We examine the military ideology of the Assyrians, the internationalism of the Persians, the culture of classical Athens that built the Parthenon, the sweeping conquests of Alexander the Great, the hybrid culture of Kleopatra's Egypt, and the economic-military power of Rome under Caesar and Augustus.

<title> Russia and the US: Comparative politics</title>
<synopsis> The subject examines the domestic politics of Russia and United States. Both countries are two of the most powerful and influential countries within the Asia-Pacific region and globally. Developing knowledge of Russian and American politics and societies, students will enhance their understanding of the dynamics of governing ethnically and religiously diverse societies with many competing-and at times sharply antagonistic-interests, and countries with substantial military and economic prowess. The unit closely analyses both countries' political cultures, electoral politics, political institutions and contemporary social issues (i.e., debates over gender and minority rights), and struggles with extremism and terrorism. Notably, the subject addresses the extent to which Russia's conception of 'Sovereign Democracy' and the US' 'American Exceptionalism' influence how Russian and American citizens (and politicians) view themselves and their countries' status in the world, and if this makes them unique as powerful states, or whether their political behaviour and sense of national identity and destiny are common amongst modern nation-states. Upon completing the subject, students should have also developed a nuanced grasp of the broader field of comparative politics, and its main conceptual approaches and interpretive frameworks-to complement their knowledge of Russian and US politics.</synopsis>

<title> Research practices</title>
<synopsis> Research Practices is a core unit in the Visual Arts sequence and is one of four first year units. This unit is a practice driven, workshop based unit which explores varied drawing methodologies and ways they can contribute to a research practice in visual culture. It is designed to develop, challenge and expand how students think about making artwork and to develop research skills. A series of individual and collaborative exercises and projects are presented as starting points that, when navigated, foster creative research skills and develop students' material skills. The main emphasis of this class is to demonstrate how thinking operates through making. Fabrication processes in the workshop can be in any medium from across two- and/or three-dimensional works, to sound and performance. The aim of these exercises is to have a generative influence on production, creating a pool of ideas, strategies, forms and processes for students to draw on and develop as they progress through the course. Teaching methodology involves critical dialogue, classroom discussion and peer review. This unit presents a broad range of approaches to contemporary art and its institutions for those wishing to work in the arts industry as artists, curators, arts writers, educators or practitioners. Research Practices encourages an experimental approach to conceptual and material outcomes. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication and materials are core values in the unit.</synopsis>

<synopsis> This unit will introduce students to an understanding of leadership in the human  services in Australia as a requirement for social work practice, one that is not always understood or accepted professionally. The human services sector is expanding in the numbers of its component organisations, both governmental and non-governmental, and in the size and complexity of the component parts. Leadership of social change and social justice in the human services is now at a premium, having been given little attention in the past or currently. Little is known of leadership requirements in this sector particularly as contrasted with other service sectors. Students undertaking this unit will be introduced to theories of leadership of human-service organisations, their programs and policies, and leadership of the new organisational phenomena in this sector, large community service departments, non-governmental consortia, and advocacy organisations.

<title> Polymers and ceramics 2</title>
<synopsis> The importance of ceramic properties on their manufacturing is highlighted. The mechanical and thermal properties of ceramics, the structure and production of amorphous ceramics and porous ceramics, the glass transition, optical and electrical properties of glass. The mechanical properties of polymers are very dependent on the timescale and temperature and so the structural basis of linear viscoelasticity and time/temperature superposition are discussed. The mechanical properties of elastomers, crosslinking and reinforcement, rubber elasticity and the tear and fatigue of elastomers. The Eyring theory and methods of toughening polymers are discussed.</synopsis>

Students gain critical insight into key forms of reporting that raise issues of advocacy, agency and accountability, including environmental journalism, peace and development reporting, and public journalism. By exploring the rationale behind each, students learn to approach news not as a series of discrete violent events but rather as part of complex, ongoing processes of social and environmental change.

<title> Options, futures and risk management</title>
<synopsis> This unit examines how options and futures can be used for hedging risk in the process of risk management. Several aspects of risk management are examined, including the reasons why investors indulge in this activity, how value is created via risk management, and the firm-wide approach to risk management (given that any firm is exposed to a wide variety of risks). Once the importance of risk management has been established, emphasis turns to the use of derivatives (futures and options) to manage risk. To understand how they are used to manage risk, the unit also considers the characteristics and pricing of these instruments, including some exotic versions.</synopsis>

Students undertake an individual self-guided learning task in the form of a research project. The project topic must be in a significantly different mining area to the topic chosen in MNE4050. Greater depth is expected in the investigation of the topic compared to MNE4050 since the basic research skills have already been developed previously. However, the depth expected is less than that required in the full year single project topic completed as MNE4050 and MNE4070 together.

The unit then considers contemporary issues that affect the cross-cultural communication process (e.g.: ethics) before considering the international negotiation process. Objectives, methods of negotiation and ways of negotiating cross-culturally are considered. The unit seeks to impart to students the ability and an awareness of how to communicate effectively in a cross-cultural setting.</synopsis>

<title> Sex, gender and power in the ancient Near East</title>
<synopsis> This unit explores the tension between sex, gender and power as it played out in the literature and art of the Ancient Near East through such artefacts as the Epic of Gilgamesh, the love poems of the Sumerians, Egyptians, and Israelites, coupling images from Babylon, texts detailing the intimate domestic life of the inhabitants of an ancient Egyptian town, and the records of the female Egyptian king Hatshepsut. We examine accounts of female and male sexuality -as well as the ambiguously gendered images of eunuchs- and attempt to untangle the cultural mesh that is formed by the intersection of sexuality and power. We explore how our own assumptions about sexuality, gender and power might be challenged by a close examination of the different perspectives encountered in the ancient world.</synopsis>

<title> Perspectives on global business issues</title>
<synopsis> This is an interdisciplinary capstone unit for the Bachelor of Business Science program. It aims to help students integrate the diverse discipline knowledge and skills they acquired in prior studies and apply their learning to solve business problems. Students will identify innovative solutions to problems in a simulated experiential environment from a total organisation perspective. In the unit students are expected to bring together all the essential elements of running a business including strategic planning, leadership, ethical decision making, teamwork, cause and effect relationships between functional areas (research and development, marketing, production and finance), satisfying customer demands, and competitive analysis in a simulated learning environment. More specifically, students will learn the value of 'focusing' on the strategic implementation process, understand how decisions in one part of the business impacts other parts of the business, practice decision-making as a team across all key areas of a business, use the information from balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements to improve business decision making, analyse competitors' performance and market positioning and build core competencies within the business to take a differentiation or low cost position in the marketplace.</synopsis>

<title> European integration and security</title>
<synopsis> War and security have been crucial motors of international relations, not least in Europe the birthplace of the Westphalian state system. The European Union is commonly seen to have been an antidote to war, ushering in an era of Kantian peace; a view powerfully endorsed by the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the EU in 2012. Despite the strength of this view, recent research suggests it is possible to look at the relationship between peace and European unity differently. In fact, European unity has been propelled by war since 1945: not just at the founding moment at the end of the Second World War (NATO, EEC, WEU), but by anti-colonial nationalists pushing European powers towards pro-active European policies, and in EU responses to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia (OSCE, CFSP), Iraq, Libya and the challenges posed by refugee movements and global terrorism. An unintended consequence of the logic of deeper integration has been the consolidation of a European identity amongst some elites, whilst political and popular support for the EU has weakened. This last development poses serious questions about the future shape the state system in what remains a major player in regimes of global governance and security.</synopsis>

It seeks to equip students with the academic skills, tertiary literacies and attitudes essential for successful university study.  The coverage of a range of key skills ranging from academic writing to critical reading is unified thematically by a consideration of what makes university study different, the benefits of a university education and the development of graduate attributes. Throughout the unit, there will be an emphasis on the utility and transferability of these academic skills and competencies for employability, lifelong learning, and to other subjects undertaken so that students can navigate their own learning. Contextualised within themes and topics, lectures will situate skills development within current research, and highlight salient principles and practices. Tutorials will involve participation in a variety of tasks, focusing on discussion, assessment, application, practice and analysis of skills development in context.</synopsis>

<title> Ethics and the modern world</title>
<synopsis> The unit adopts a global perspective but looks at issues through a South African and African lens. The theories of utilitarianism and deontology will be examined within the South African context and judged according to ethical dilemmas that arise within the country. Key to this examination will be a discussion of the role of friendship and family within ethical decision-making. A major focus of discussion is the opposition between consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, which judge rightness and wrongness solely in terms of consequences, and the Kantian theory of deontology which judges rightness and wrongness according to whether the act is in accordance with rational will. The question that will guide this discussion is whether these theories can account for the agent-centred reasons which arise from relations of love and friendship and which seem to have the potential to conflict with impartial moral requirements?</synopsis>

<title> Australians at war</title>
<synopsis> How has war shaped Australians and Australian society and why has war become central to national mythology and identity? This unit explores the experience of Australians at war - both overseas and on the home front - from confrontations between indigenous Australians and European settlers on the colonial frontier through the major conflicts of the twentieth century, with a particular focus on the two World Wars. We examine the 'face of battle' and how war affected men and women on the front line (including indigenous servicemen), and we consider how war was experienced on the home front and reshaped Australian society. We explore the contested creation of an 'Anzac legend' and how war challenged and consolidated social relations and national identities. Students will undertake hands-on research using the rich primary source record of Australians at war, including service records, diaries and letters, oral histories, photographs and repatriation files that illuminate the impact of war on veterans, their families, and their communities.</synopsis>

<title> God, freedom and evil</title>
<synopsis> Are there successful arguments for or against the existence of God? We start by examining what it takes for an argument to be successful. We then examine some of the best known arguments for the existence of God--Anselm's ontological argument, Aquinas' second way, Paley's argument for design, Pascal's wager--and some of the best known arguments against the existence of God--Mackie's and Rowe's arguments from evil--and try to determine whether or not they succeed.</synopsis>

<title> Political ideologies</title>
<synopsis> In most democracies, politics is dominated by political parties that are organised around competing ideologies. Ideologies offer explanations for the problems with the status quo, and advocate a programme for creating a better world. They can exert a powerful hold on their adherents, and clashes between ideologies have resulted in terrible wars. As a result, it is important to understand what different ideologies say. In this module, students will learn to identify and evaluate a variety of ideological traditions. This course will introduce students to the 'classical' political ideologies of liberalism, conservatism and socialism. It will also discuss newer ideological trends, such as feminism, green politics, and religious fundamentalism.

<synopsis> Physical oceanography is the study of the ocean, its motion and the underlying physical processes.  This unit will begin with a brief foray into descriptive physical oceanography, where details of the mean circulation and physical structure of the ocean will be presented along with the oceanographic past and present instruments and observing platforms.  The unit will then cover aspects of dynamical physical oceanography particularly relevant for tropical and subtropical oceans, including the introduction of the equations of motion, Ekman layer theory and wind-driven circulation, geostrophic circulation, western boundary currents and internal waves.  The unit will then finish by introducing interactions at the air-sea interface and how the related coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics can lead to climatically relevant modes of climate variability, like the El Nino-southern oscillation.</synopsis>

<title> Literary theory</title>
<synopsis> What is the relationship between reading and thinking?. And what are the particular ways of thinking that help and enrich how we read fiction, poetry, drama and literary non-fiction?. Literary theory refers to particular intellectual approaches or frameworks that assist us with understanding, enjoying, constructing meaning from and discussing literary texts. This unit provides a succinct and practical approach to the topic of literary theory. It provides students with the philosophical foundations of modern literary theory, and also with informative and interactive seminars on the contemporary schools of literary theory such as Marxist theory, psychoanalytic theory, poststructuralist theory, feminist theory and postcolonial theory. The unit then instructs the students on how to apply these theoretical approaches to the study of their favourite literary works, and it also provides those students interested in creative writing with the opportunity to develop their own literary and exegetical writings according to the insights of some of the world's major theorists of literature.</synopsis>

<synopsis> This unit considers why freedom of speech is important to the media and how it is protected in Australia. The unit also covers the three major restraints on freedom of speech; the law of defamation, the action for breach of confidence and laws that protect privacy, both incidentally and intentionally. These will be considered from the perspective of how these laws inhibit the media in the collection and dissemination of information. Due consideration will be given to whether an appropriate balance is struck between freedom of speech and other rights, such as the protection of reputation. Reform of the law will also be considered, particularly the need for uniform defamation laws.</synopsis>
