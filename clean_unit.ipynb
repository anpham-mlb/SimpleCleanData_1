In many materials, including single crystals, textured polycrystals and composites, the physical properties depend on the direction, i.e. they are anisotropic. Describing anisotropy requires proper mathematical tools, as well as an understanding of the material structure at the relevant length scale in order to quantify the property coefficients in various directions. In this unit, we introduce tensors and matrices as mathematical tools to describe anisotropic properties and calculate property relationships in different directions. Material symmetry arguments are introduced to identify the number of independent property coefficients. Mechanical, thermal and electrical properties are systematically investigated (elasticity, electrical permittivity, heat conduction...), including coupled effects (e.g. piezoelectricity, thermal expansion...).

We focus on the development of the first empires in the Mediterranean including Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Athens, Macedonia of Alexander the Great, and Rome as well as the original spread of settlements in Australia and the Pacific. We explore how archaeological remains and historical texts can be used to study the movement of people and ideas and to identify the tactics states use to expand, strengthen, and celebrate their power, including military conquest, colonisation, trade, art, and literature. We examine the military ideology of the Assyrians, the internationalism of the Persians, the culture of classical Athens that built the Parthenon, the sweeping conquests of Alexander the Great, the hybrid culture of Kleopatra\\'s Egypt, and the economic-military power of Rome under Caesar and Augustus.

The unit closely analyses both countries\\' political cultures, electoral politics, political institutions and contemporary social issues (i.e., debates over gender and minority rights), and struggles with extremism and terrorism. Notably, the subject addresses the extent to which Russia\\'s conception of \\'Sovereign Democracy\\' and the US\\' \\'American Exceptionalism\\' influence how Russian and American citizens (and politicians) view themselves and their countries\\' status in the world, and if this makes them unique as powerful states, or whether their political behaviour and sense of national identity and destiny are common amongst modern nation-states.

The unit will also consider more recent pan-Asian productions and diasporic cinemas including Asian Australian cinema. An analysis of television dramas and reality TV formats in Asia will allow us to consider changing audience tastes and consumption practices.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of the subject students will be able to demonstrate:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>An ability to discuss particular examples of Asian Cinema and Television texts in ways that show some understanding of generic considerations, cultural differences and historical specificity;</li>\\n<li>A general theoretical awareness of the problematic of cross cultural readings;</li>\\n<li>Some understanding of how cinema has developed across national and transnational film industries in different parts of the world.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

This unit is a practice driven, workshop based unit which explores varied drawing methodologies and ways they can contribute to a research practice in visual culture. It is designed to develop, challenge and expand how students think about making artwork and to develop research skills. A series of individual and collaborative exercises and projects are presented as starting points that, when navigated, foster creative research skills and develop students\\' material skills. The main emphasis of this class is to demonstrate how thinking operates through making. Fabrication processes in the workshop can be in any medium from across two- and/or three-dimensional works, to sound and performance. The aim of these exercises is to have a generative influence on production, creating a pool of ideas, strategies, forms and processes for students to draw on and develop as they progress through the course. Teaching methodology involves critical dialogue, classroom discussion and peer review. This unit presents a broad range of approaches to contemporary art and its institutions for those wishing to work in the arts industry as artists, curators, arts writers, educators or practitioners.

Students will explore the various registers, genres and venues in which the discussion of art is carried out today - from academic journals, magazines, newspapers to online. Students will both gain a theoretical perspective on these different approaches to the discussion of art and their various histories and themselves undertake a number of practical exercises in writing in these different styles and formats. Students will especially be directed to thinking what is the future of the discussion of art in the new age of the internet and the electronic media. What opportunities can they think of for themselves and others to put the art-historical knowledge they otherwise gain in their studies to practical use in the public arena?</p>\\n<p>Throughout the unit a number of practical exercises in writing about art will be undertaken, giving students a sense of the different requirements for different kinds of writing. Above all, they will form the habit of writing about art, and understand that writing about art is a \"practice\" just as artists have a practice. To this extent, Art Writing and Criticism must be seen as allied to the new units offered in art curation (Curating: Histories and Theories and Curating: Practices) in opening up to students studying Art History certain \"practical\" or \"vocational\" outcomes for their skills and knowledges.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of this

A student project, involving the initial design stages of a flight vehicle, will integrate these studies. Various characteristics of aircraft performance and their design implications will be examined including whole-aircraft drag polar, power plant characterisation, thrust required in level flight, maximum speed estimation, minimum speed and high-lift devices, rate of climb, gliding, range, endurance, accelerated flight, structural limitations on performance, and design for longitudinal and lateral stability. Mission analysis and preliminary weight estimation based on a design concept will be examined together with the aerodynamic synthesis to satisfy performance requirements, power plant selection, overall vehicle layout and balance. Trade-offs as a necessary part of the design will be apparent to students on completion of this unit.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>At the successful completion of this unit you will be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Justify preliminary aircraft sizing based on mission requirements and weight correlations.</li>\\n<li>Draw upon constraint analysis to size aircraft propulsion and lifting surfaces to meet specified performance requirements.</li>\\n<li>Generate aircraft layouts to appropriate Joint Aviation Requirements (JARs).</li>\\n<li>Predict aircraft drag polars by a variety of methods.</li>\\n<li>Construct an appropriately dimensioned and labelled 3-view drawing of final aircraft design.</li>\\n<li>Manage the distribution of aircraft components to appropriately locate the aircraft centre of gravity.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Continuous assessment: 70%</p>\\n<p>Examination (2 hours): 30%</p>\\n<p>Students are required to achieve at least 45% in the total continuous assessment component and at least 45% in the final examination component and an overall mark of 50% to achieve a pass grade in the unit.

Students will examine how animals and plants, through the agents of gene mutation and natural selection, are able to adapt to new and changing environments. Diverse physiological, reproductive and behavioural solutions to life\\'s challenges will be used to illustrate how evolutionary forces and constraints shape us and the world around us. We will then examine how interactions within and between species and with the non-living environment generate the immense ecological variety seen on Earth. Contemporary issues and the societal impact of biology will be explored by learning from world-class researchers and industry experts.</p>\\n<p>Students will undertake self-directed learning through the online environment. These online activities, readings and instructional videos will be complemented by face-to-face workshops where they will collaborate with peers and teaching staff to deepen their understanding of the biological concepts introduced each week. Students will gain hands-on experience and develop experimental and analytical skills in the laboratory environment. Optional drop-in tutorials are available for additional learning support.

The human services sector is expanding in the numbers of its component organisations, both governmental and non-governmental, and in the size and complexity of the component parts. Leadership of social change and social justice in the human services is now at a premium, having been given little attention in the past or currently. Little is known of leadership requirements in this sector particularly as contrasted with other service sectors. Students undertaking this unit will be introduced to theories of leadership of human-service organisations, their programs and policies, and leadership of the new organisational phenomena in this sector, large community service departments, non-governmental consortia, and advocacy organisations.

Students will explore the various registers, genres and venues in which the discussion of art is carried out today - from academic journals, magazines, newspapers to online. Students will both gain a theoretical perspective on these different approaches to the discussion of art and their various histories and themselves undertake a number of practical exercises in writing in these different styles and formats. Students will especially be directed to thinking what is the future of the discussion of art in the new age of the internet and the electronic media. What opportunities can they think of for themselves and others to put the art-historical knowledge they otherwise gain in their studies to practical use in the public arena?</p>\\n<p>Throughout the unit a number of practical exercises in writing about art will be undertaken, giving students a sense of the different requirements for different kinds of writing. Above all, they will form the habit of writing about art, and understand that writing about art is a \"practice\" just as artists have a practice. To this extent, Art Writing and Criticism must be seen as allied to the new units offered in art curation (Curating: Histories and Theories and Curating: Practices) in opening up to students studying Art History certain \"practical\" or \"vocational\" outcomes for their skills and knowledges.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of this unit students will be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Identify and analyse the different places and formats in which the discussion of art takes place;</li>\\n<li>Demonstrate practical mastery of the various genres and styles of art writing;</li>\\n<li>Apply good work habits with regard to their own \"art writing\" practice;</li>\\n<li>Develop new venues and opportunities for art writing in the 21st century;</li>\\n<li>Employ new skills in online web publishing, graphic design and layout required to self- and other-publish online and in book and magazine production.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>100% in-semester assessment</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>12 hours per week including 3 contact hours plus 9 hours of independent study, or equivalent.</p><p>See also <a href=\"http://www.monash.edu.au/timetables/\">Unit timetable information</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<!-- /.content_container--> </div>\\n<!-- /.content-inner__main --></div>\\n\\n<div class=\"content-inner__main\">\\n<!-- breadcrumbs -->\\n<nav class=\"breadcrumbs mobile-hidden\" id=\"breadcrumbs\">\\n<p class=\"visuallyhidden\" id=\"breadcrumb__label\">You are here:</p>\\n<ul aria-labelledby=\"breadcrumb__label\" class=\"breadcrumbs__list\">\\n<li class=\"breadcrumbs__item home\">\\n<a class=\"breadcrumbs__link\" href=\"https://www.monash.edu/\">Home</a>\\n<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"breadcrumbs__divider\">|</span>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"breadcrumbs__item\">\\n<a class=\"breadcrumbs__link\" href=\"https://www.monash.edu/study\">Study</a>\\n<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"breadcrumbs__divider\">|</span>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"breadcrumbs__item\">\\n<a class=\"breadcrumbs__link\" href=\"/pubs/2019handbooks/\">2019 Handbooks</a>\\n<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"breadcrumbs__divider\">|</span>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"breadcrumbs__item breadcrumbs__current\"><a class=\"breadcrumbs__link\" href=\"/pubs/2019handbooks/units\">Units</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</nav>\\n<div class=\"hbk-banner-box\">\\n'), ('NUR1010', 'Foundations of nursing and midwifery practice', '\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"content_container_\">\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-eftsl\">6 points, SCA Band 1, 0.125 EFTSL</h2>\\n<div class=\"hbk-unit-info-box\" id=\"box-NUR1010\">\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-unit-info-box__heading heading_med\">Undergraduate - Unit</h2>\\n<p class=\"hbk-highlight-value\">Refer to the specific\\n         <a href=\"http://monash.edu/enrolments/dates/census.html\">census and withdrawal dates</a>\\n         for the semester(s) in which this unit is offered.</p>\\n<p class=\"hbk-highlight-heading\">Faculty</p>\\n<p class=\"hbk-highlight-value\"><a href=\"index-byfaculty-med.html\">Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences</a></p>\\n<p class=\"hbk-highlight-heading\">Organisational Unit</p>\\n<p class=\"hbk-highlight-value\"><a href=\"index-byou-school-of-nursing-and-midwifery.html\">School of Nursing and Midwifery</a></p>\\n<p class=\"hbk-highlight-heading\">Chief examiner(s)</p>\\n<p>\\n<a href=\"http://staffsearch.monash.edu/?name=Monica O\\'Halloran\">Ms Monica O\\'Halloran</a>\\n<br/>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"hbk-highlight-heading\">Coordinator(s)</p>\\n<p>\\n<a href=\"http://staffsearch.monash.edu/?name=Monica O\\'Halloran\">Ms Monica O\\'Halloran</a>\\n        \\n        (Peninsula)\\n      \\n    <br/>\\n</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"hbk-preamble \" id=\"preamble-NUR1010\">\\n<div class=\"hbk-preamble-entry\">\\n<div class=\"hbk-preamble-icon hbk-preamble-icon_mode\"></div>\\n<p>Not offered in 2019</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"hbk-preamble-entry\">\\n<p class=\"hbk-preamble-heading\">Co-requisites</p>\\n<p>Must be enrolled in courses 0727 or 2552 or 3562 or 3892 or 4514.</p>\\n<p class=\"hbk-preamble-heading\">Prohibitions</p>\\n<p>NUR1101.</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Synopsis</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>This unit introduces students to the beginning knowledge and skills of the</p>\\n<p>professional registered nurse.

Once the importance of risk management has been established, emphasis turns to the use of derivatives (futures and options) to manage risk.

The decision must be made at the time of choosing the project topic for MNE4050. The aim in choosing MNE4050 and MNE4070 together is to gain knowledge across two differing project areas within mining, as opposed to MNE4050 and MNE4060 which provides depth in one project topic. Students undertake an individual self-guided learning task in the form of a research project. The project topic must be in a significantly different mining area to the topic chosen in MNE4050. Greater depth is expected in the investigation of the topic compared to MNE4050 since the basic research skills have already been developed previously. However, the depth expected is less than that required in the full year single project topic completed as MNE4050 and MNE4070 together.

class=\"hbk-heading\">Synopsis</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>This unit will introduce students to an understanding of leadership in the human  services in Australia as a requirement for social work practice, one that is not always understood or accepted professionally. The human services sector is expanding in the numbers of its component organisations, both governmental and non-governmental, and in the size and complexity of the component parts. Leadership of social change and social justice in the human services is now at a premium, having been given little attention in the past or currently. Little is known of leadership requirements in this sector particularly as contrasted with other service sectors. Students undertaking this unit will be introduced to theories of leadership of human-service organisations, their programs and policies, and leadership of the new organisational phenomena in this sector, large community service departments, non-governmental consortia, and advocacy organisations. They will also be introduced to other notions of leadership in social work - leadership through research, advocacy and community action.</p>\\n<p>Subsequently, theories of leadership will be placed against the experiences and views of current social work leaders in this sector, who will be active participants in this unit, so that students gain some understanding of what leadership comprises, what priority actual leaders place on the various aspects of leadership, and what research and theory underpins actual leadership in the policy development, planning and delivery of social services today.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of this unit, students should be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Describe leadership within a professional social work framework through analysis of historical and current leadership examples from the human services sector.</li>\\n<li>Critically analyse theories of leadership for the human services in Australia.</li>\\n<li>Contrast leadership theories with selected leaders\\' experiences and identify and analyse the differences.</li>\\n<li>Articulate where leadership opportunities and responsibilities exist within the human services sector.</li>\\n<li>Identify the components of leadership in the human-services sector and the distinguishing features of leadership in the human services field.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A critical analysis of contemporary leadership theories in the light of presentations in the classroom and conveyed online, from social work leaders during the unit (2,000 words) (40%)</li>\\n<li>An assessment of their own actual and potential contribution to social work leadership, based on critical reflection on practice experience, current data on leadership in a specific field of practice and analysis of relevant literature (2,500 words) (60%).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Students must pass both assessment tasks in order to complete the unit successfully.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>3 hours per week.</p><p>See also <a href=\"http://www.monash.edu.au/timetables/\">Unit timetable information</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">This unit applies to the following area(s) of study</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p><a href=\"../aos/health-science\">Health science</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Additional information on this unit is available from the faculty at:</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.med.monash.edu.au/socialwork/\">http://www.med.monash.edu.au/socialwork/</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<!-- /.content_container--> </div>\\n<!-- /.content-inner__main --></div>\\n\\n<div class=\"content-inner__main\">\\n<!-- breadcrumbs -->\\n<nav class=\"breadcrumbs mobile-hidden\" id=\"breadcrumbs\">\\n<p class=\"visuallyhidden\" id=\"breadcrumb__label\">You are here:</p>\\n<ul aria-labelledby=\"breadcrumb__label\" class=\"breadcrumbs__list\">\\n<li class=\"breadcrumbs__item home\">\\n<a class=\"breadcrumbs__link\" href=\"https://www.monash.edu/\">Home</a>\\n<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"breadcrumbs__divider\">|</span>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"breadcrumbs__item\">\\n<a class=\"breadcrumbs__link\" href=\"https://www.monash.edu/study\">Study</a>\\n<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"breadcrumbs__divider\">|</span>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"breadcrumbs__item\">\\n<a class=\"breadcrumbs__link\" href=\"/pubs/2019handbooks/\">2019 Handbooks</a>\\n<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"breadcrumbs__divider\">|</span>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"breadcrumbs__item breadcrumbs__current\"><a class=\"breadcrumbs__link\" href=\"/pubs/2019handbooks/units\">Units</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</nav>\\n<div class=\"hbk-banner-box\">\\n'), ('SWK4400', 'Critical social work 3: Group work and community engagement (context and practice)', '\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"content_container_\">\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-eftsl\">6 points, SCA Band 1, 0.125 EFTSL</h2>\\n<div class=\"hbk-unit-info-box\" id=\"box-SWK4400\">\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-unit-info-box__heading heading_med\">Undergraduate -

The human services sector is expanding in the numbers of its component organisations, both governmental and non-governmental, and in the size and complexity of the component parts. Leadership of social change and social justice in the human services is now at a premium, having been given little attention in the past or currently. Little is known of leadership requirements in this sector particularly as contrasted with other service sectors. Students undertaking this unit will be introduced to theories of leadership of humanservice organisations, their programs and policies, and leadership of the new organisational phenomena in this sector, large community service departments, non-governmental consortia, and advocacy organisations. They will also be introduced to other notions of leadership in social work - leadership through research, advocacy and community action.</p>\\n<p>Subsequently, theories of leadership will be placed against the experiences and views of current social work leaders in this sector, who will be active participants in this unit, so that students gain some understanding of what leadership comprises, what priority actual leaders place on the various aspects of leadership, and what research and theory underpins actual leadership in the policy development, planning and delivery of social services today.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of this unit, students should be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Describe leadership within a professional social work framework through analysis of historical and current leadership examples from the human services sector.</li>\\n<li>Critically analyse theories of leadership for the human services in Australia.</li>\\n<li>Contrast leadership theories with selected leaders\\' experiences and identify and analyse the differences.</li>\\n<li>Articulate where leadership opportunities and responsibilities exist within the human services sector.</li>\\n<li>Identify the components of leadership in the humanservices sector and the distinguishing features of leadership in the human services field.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A critical analysis of contemporary leadership theories in the light of presentations in the classroom and conveyed online, from social work leaders during the unit (2,000 words) (40%)</li>\\n<li>An assessment of their own actual and potential contribution to social work leadership, based on critical reflection on practice experience,current data on leadership in a specific field of practice and analysis of relevant literature (2,500 words) (60%)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Students must pass both assessment tasks in order to complete the unit successfully.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>This unit is taught over an 8 week period beginning in Week 8 of semester, with an expected 156 hours of study.</p><p>See also <a href=\"http://www.monash.edu.au/timetables/\">Unit timetable information</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Off-campus attendance requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p></p><p>3 hours per week.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">This unit applies to the following area(s) of study</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p><a href=\"../aos/social-work\">Social work</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Additional information on this unit is available from the faculty at:</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.med.monash.edu.au/socialwork/\">http://www.med.monash.edu.au/socialwork/</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<!-- /.content_container--> </div>\\n<!-- /.content-inner__main --></div>\\n\\n<div class=\"content-inner__main\">\\n<!-- breadcrumbs -->\\n<nav class=\"breadcrumbs mobile-hidden\" id=\"breadcrumbs\">\\n<p class=\"visuallyhidden\" id=\"breadcrumb__label\">You are here:</p>\\n<ul aria-labelledby=\"breadcrumb__label\" class=\"breadcrumbs__list\">\\n<li class=\"breadcrumbs__item home\">\\n<a class=\"breadcrumbs__link\" href=\"https://www.monash.edu/\">Home</a>\\n<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"breadcrumbs__divider\">|</span>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"breadcrumbs__item\">\\n<a class=\"breadcrumbs__link\" href=\"https://www.monash.edu/study\">Study</a>\\n<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"breadcrumbs__divider\">|</span>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"breadcrumbs__item\">\\n<a class=\"breadcrumbs__link\" href=\"/pubs/2019handbooks/\">2019 Handbooks</a>\\n<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"breadcrumbs__divider\">|</span>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"breadcrumbs__item breadcrumbs__current\"><a class=\"breadcrumbs__link\" href=\"/pubs/2019handbooks/units\">Units</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</nav>\\n<div class=\"hbk-banner-box\">\\n'), ('CMH5003', 'Concepts in mental health illness', '\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"content_container_\">\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-eftsl\">6 points, SCA Band 1, 0.125 EFTSL</h2>\\n<div class=\"hbk-unit-info-box\" id=\"box-CMH5003\">\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-unit-info-box__heading heading_med\">Postgraduate -

We examine accounts of female and male sexuality -as well as the ambiguously gendered images of eunuchs- and attempt to untangle the cultural mesh that is formed by the intersection of sexuality and power.

The European Union is commonly seen to have been an antidote to war, ushering in an era of Kantian peace; a view powerfully endorsed by the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the EU in 2012. Despite the strength of this view, recent research suggests it is possible to look at the relationship between peace and European unity differently. In fact, European unity has been propelled by war since 1945: not just at the founding moment at the end of the Second World War (NATO, EEC, WEU), but by anti-colonial nationalists pushing European powers towards pro-active European policies, and in EU responses to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia (OSCE, CFSP), Iraq, Libya and the challenges posed by refugee movements and global terrorism. An unintended consequence of the logic of deeper integration has been the consolidation of a European identity amongst some elites, whilst political and popular support for the EU has weakened. This last development poses serious questions about the future shape the state system in what remains a major player in regimes of global governance and security.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of the unit, students will be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>identify and appraise the concepts, parameters and architecture of European security in a global context;</li>\\n<li>distinguish between the concepts of traditional and non-traditional security and recognise the competing paradigms in the security studies literature;</li>\\n<li>explain and analyse the course and dynamics of European integration since the end of the second World War;</li>\\n<li>integrate one set of academic literature (European integration theory and history) with another (European security);</li>\\n<li>undertake a research analysis of an important aspect of European integration or a major security policy area, utilising primary and secondary-source materials with written feedback.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

The theories of utilitarianism and deontology will be examined within the South African context and judged according to ethical dilemmas that arise within the country. Key to this examination will be a discussion of the role of friendship and family within ethical decision-making. A major focus of discussion is the opposition between consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, which judge rightness and wrongness solely in terms of consequences, and the Kantian theory of deontology which judges rightness and wrongness according to whether the act is in accordance with rational will. The question that will guide this discussion is whether these theories can account for the agent-centred reasons which arise from relations of love and friendship and which seem to have the potential to conflict with impartial moral requirements?</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Capacity to critically analyse central ethical theories such as consequentialism and Kantianism.</li>\\n<li>Have developed skills important to the discipline of philosophy, such as argument analysis, textual interpretation, and argument construction.</li>\\n<li>Capacity to develop a theoretical position and argument concerning the main theories and arguments in meta-ethics.</li>\\n<li>Be able to critically assess society and its accompanying ethical problems in South Africa from the point of view of the unit.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 60% + Exam: 40%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

The work placement is aimed at consolidating and extending what they have learnt from core units and other Degree units, through experiential learning. The unit develops their understanding of the application of academically obtained knowledge and skills in a workplace environment, and facilitates their acquisition of work-based networks for potential employment opportunities. Separate internship programs are drawn up for each student.</p>\\n<p>As a capstone unit for those who intend to major in Gender Studies, this unit serves as the practicum for Gender and Sexuality Studies. The capstone experience enables these students to reflexively engage with the application of feminist and queer theories to the workplace. Work placements in non-governmental organisations in global contexts are strongly encouraged as these settings led themselves more adequately to such critical engagement of synergising the learning in the classroom and learning within the community.

We examine the \\'face of battle\\' and how war affected men and women on the front line (including indigenous servicemen), and we consider how war was experienced on the home front and reshaped Australian society. We explore the contested creation of an \\'Anzac legend\\' and how war challenged and consolidated social relations and national identities.

The first module seeks to extend students knowledge of fundamental pharmacological principles of medication management which can be adopted and utilized in the advanced practice setting. Students will use the foundational knowledge of pharmokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and therapeutics, in order to critically analyse how medications affect physiological, biochemical and pathophysiological processes. With a greater appreciation of the action of drugs on body processes, students will be able to determine which medications should be administered to particular patients in order to ensure therapeutic effects are optimized and adverse effects are minimized. Students will articulate the key pharmacological characteristics of drug classes, as well as derive an understanding of specific features of individual drugs.</p>\\n<p>The second module extends students\\' knowledge of social, political and ethical principles of medication management, and allows the student to explore how these principles are applied in the advanced practice setting. The concepts of pain management, adverse drug reactions and medication use across the lifespan will be considered. Students will individualise the use of the clinical decision making process as the framework for gathering and organizing medication information, planning, prescribing, administering, documenting and evaluation to suit their own practice needs. Students will extend their knowledge of the learning and teaching strategies for patient education and the government policies that are relevant to nurse prescribing.

And what are the particular ways of thinking that help and enrich how we read fiction, poetry, drama and literary non-fiction?. Literary theory refers to particular intellectual approaches or frameworks that assist us with understanding, enjoying, constructing meaning from and discussing literary texts. This unit provides a succinct and practical approach to the topic of literary theory. It provides students with the philosophical foundations of modern literary theory, and also with informative and interactive seminars on the contemporary schools of literary theory such as Marxist theory, psychoanalytic theory, poststructuralist theory, feminist theory and postcolonial theory.

An unusual feature of the subject is that each topic is introduced by way of science fiction stories in which metaphysical issues are explored. So the first topic takes off from a discussion of time travel.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>On completing this subject students will have an understanding of some main theories in metaphysics and will have reflected on the impact of recent developments in science and philosophy on our most fundamental views about ourselves and our place in the world. The subject will further develop capacities for critical thought by introducing students to the systematic study of techniques for the evaluation of arguments and reasoning.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 60% + Exam: 40%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

Using a political economy approach, the unit will provide a comparative perspective on Brazil, Russia, China, India and South Africa also known as the BRICS. Over the past ten years the geo-political and economic importance of the BRICS has been increasing. While they have been advocating for a stronger voice in major international institutions such as the WTO, the World Bank and the IMF, the BRICS do not have a common identity and their influence and power at the global level is uneven. This unit covers the history of the BRICS as well as the political, economic, security and foreign policy trends in these countries. It provides different perspectives on the power of the BRICS in an international context and focuses on the challenges they face.

The unit also covers the three major restraints on freedom of speech; the law of defamation, the action for breach of confidence and laws that protect privacy, both incidentally and intentionally. These will be considered from the perspective of how these laws inhibit the media in the collection and dissemination of information. Due consideration will be given to whether an appropriate balance is struck between freedom of speech and other rights, such as the protection of reputation. Reform of the law will also be considered, particularly the need for uniform defamation laws.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>At the successful completion of this unit students will be able to:</p>\\n<p>Comprehend and critically analyse the laws pertaining to defamation, breach of confidence and privacy in terms of their impact on the media.
